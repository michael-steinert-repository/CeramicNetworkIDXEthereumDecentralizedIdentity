# Ceramic Network Ethereum 3ID Decentralized Identity

### Decentralized Identity
* The Transition from closed Platforms with App-specific Identities and siloed Information to open Ecosystems with User-owned Identities and portable Data

### Ceramic
* A dezentral Network of Nodes which can be write and read
* Ceramic is a decentralized, open source Platform for Creating, Hosting, and Sharing Streams of Data
* With Ceramic's Permissionless Data Streaming Network, Streams of Information and ever-changing Files directly can be stored on the decentralized Web, and share Updates with anyone in the World

### iDX
* Identity Protocol that interact with ceramic
* Shared Identity System in a dezentral Network to read and write Information about Users
* iDX is an Open Source decentralized Identity Protocol that replaces App-specific User Tables with a single User-centric Index that is shared by all Applications
* The Index provides a unified Place where all Applications can register and discover Data Sources associated to a User
* The Index allows an Application to store Data in any Storage Backend, while still providing Users with the Aggregation, Metadata, Schemas, and Routing required to make this Data consumable by any other Application

### DID Methods
* DID Methods are Implementations of the DID Specification
* DID Methods must specify a Name for the Method, a Description of where the DID Document is stored, and a DID Resolver which can return a DID Document given a URI that conforms to that particular DID Method

### 3ID
* The 3ID DID Method is a DID Method which can be used to Authenticate to Ceramic and perform Writes to Streams that rely on DIDs
* 3ID Connect is a DID provider for the 3ID DID Method
* It allows Users to use a 3ID DID with their existing Blockchain Wallets

### DIDs
* Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a Type of Identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital Identity
* A globally unique persistent Identifier that does not require a centralized Registration Authority and is often generated and/or registered cryptographically
